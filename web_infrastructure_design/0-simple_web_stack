. What is a Server?
A server is a physical or virtual machine that provides services to other computers (called clients). In this case, it hosts the web server, application code, and database needed to run a website.

. What is the Role of the Domain Name?
A domain name like www.foobar.com is a human-readable address that maps to a numeric IP address. It allows users to access a website without needing to remember the IP address of the server.

. What Type of DNS Record is "www" in www.foobar.com?
The "www" part is a subdomain, and in this case, it is typically defined using an A record. An A record maps the subdomain www.foobar.com directly to the server's IP address, which is 8.8.8.8.

. What is the Role of the Web Server?
The web server (e.g., Nginx) handles incoming HTTP or HTTPS requests from users. It serves static content like HTML, CSS, and image files and forwards dynamic requests to the application server for further processing.

. What is the Role of the Application Server?
The application server runs the backend application code. It handles dynamic operations such as user authentication, database queries, and business logic. It generates responses based on user requests and communicates with the database when needed.

. What is the Role of the Database?
The database (e.g., MySQL) stores and manages structured data used by the application. This includes information such as user accounts, posts, transactions, and other data that needs to be saved and retrieved as part of the applicationâ€™s functionality.

. What is the Server Using to Communicate with the Computer of the User Requesting the Website?
The server communicates with the user's computer using the HTTP or HTTPS protocol over the TCP/IP network. The user's browser sends an HTTP request to the server's IP address, and the server responds with the requested content or data.

Weaknesses of This Infrastructure:

. SPOF (Single Point of Failure)
There is only one server handling all functions. If it fails due to a crash, overload, or hardware issue, the entire website becomes unavailable.

. Downtime When Maintenance is Needed
Because everything is running on a single server, updating or restarting the web server or application server will cause the website to become temporarily unavailable during maintenance or deployment.

. Cannot Scale if Too Much Incoming Traffic
A single server has limited processing power and bandwidth. If a large number of users try to access the website simultaneously, the server may become slow or crash, and there is no mechanism in place to distribute the load or add additional servers.
